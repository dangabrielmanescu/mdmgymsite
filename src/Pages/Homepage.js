          <h2>What is Functional Fitness</h2>
          <p>Functional fitness is a classification of training that prepares the body for real-life movements
            and activities. Also known as functional training or functional movement, “It trains your muscles 
            to work together and prepares them for daily tasks by simulating common movements you might do at 
            home, at work, or in sports.” – Mayo Clinic. Movements such as squatting, reaching, pulling, and 
            lifting will be made easier with functional fitness integrated into your exercise routine</p>
